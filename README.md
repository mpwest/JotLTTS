Files for Jaws of the Lion Tabletop simulator mod

Mod can be played in Tabletop Simulator, and added from Steam Workshop here: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2142755012

Issues that could be improved
- Some files contain guid references that would be better suited to request from Global, in case updates are needed
  (particularly Character Setup Tiles referencing class tuckbox GUIDs)
- Style consistency in some cases, especially with string processing methods
- Some redundancy remains, in favour of avoiding further rounds of testing and releasing updates sooner

Additionally, some design choices were made to lessen the need for buttons, to balance convenience with maintaining more of a board game feel,
with collision events heavily favoured where reasonable.
